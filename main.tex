\begin{abstract}
    In this paper we introduce a probabilistic version of knowing how modalities. More precisely, our logics extend existing approaches to model the ability of an agent to achieve a goal, with a certain probability. Models of the logic are extended with probability distributions over the actions that can be executed. In turn, we investigate different variant logics with this new feature. First, we enrich with probabilities the linear plan-based logic of knowing how. Then, we consider indistinguishability classes, and obtain two logics, one that we call with `non-adaptable' plans, and another called with `adaptable' plans. For all these logics we investigate the computational complexity of their model-checking problem, obtaining uncedidability results for the first and the second logic, while for the last one the problem is decidable in polynomial time.
